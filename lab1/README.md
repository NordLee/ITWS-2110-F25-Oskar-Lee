Most of the issues that I ran into were styling related as my memory of css was a bit shaky.
For small question like how do I remove the blue line under links I referenced Stack Overflow. 
For larger issues like not understanding why my html content was not centered I referenced ChatGPT.
The writing of the HTML file was relatively straight forward as I had a reference from Into to ITWS so the majority of the lab was focused on improving my css styling.
